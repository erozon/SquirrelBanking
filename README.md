# SqurirelBanking
UBC Master's Thesis

As time goes on and the project solidifies, this repo should become more organized. As it stands, I know what most things are, but those not intimately
familiar with Squirrel Banking will be lost. Feel free to poke around. A good place to start would be the document writeup/report.pdf, but be warned:
the document rambles and meanders without any particular guiding narrative. It is this document that I've been adding to since March 2020 with developments
in Squirrel Banking as they come up. In particular, many claims are wrong, as I have a tendency to make strong claims which I later revise. 

Simulations has a lot of notebooks, and is a testament to my inability to name files in such a way that you know what they are. Notebooks are written
in SageMath, which is (in my mind, at least) just Python with a lot of extra math features added on.

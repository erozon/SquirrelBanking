\pause This slide will contain some math. \pause \bigskip

Given: \pause
\begin{itemize}
    \item A fixed, immediate reward of $P$\pause;
    \item a variable delay $t$. \pause
\end{itemize}

Determine: \pause
\begin{itemize}
    \item Growth function $G(t)$ \pause  satisfying
    \item indifference between $P$ immediately and $P\cdot G(t)$ after a delay of $t$. \pause
\end{itemize}

Figure out what the green line from before looks like.
